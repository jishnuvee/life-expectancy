The question we are attempting to answer is how long do political candidates live after the election, and we obtained data from over 1,000 candidates for governor since 1945 in the United States, to answer this question. A potential weakness of this model is that we are looking for the longevity for political candidates in general, but our data set only provides us with governor candidates since 1945, overlooking the other types of political candidates. We model the longevity of political candidates, measured as years lived after the election, as a linear function of sex and age at election. Our model estimates that for each additional year of age at the time of election, political candidates live approximately 0.66 fewer years after the election (95% CI: –0.77 to –0.54), indicating that age is a significant predictor of post-election longevity.\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 7\n  term         estimate std.error statistic   p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    58.3      2.58     22.6    3.50e-106   53.3      63.4  \n2 sexMale         0.146    2.40      0.0607 9.52e-  1   -4.56      4.85 \n3 election_age   -0.681    0.0167  -40.7    6.58e-298   -0.714    -0.649\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nLower CI\nUpper CI\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n58.31\n53.26\n63.36\n\n\nsexMale\n0.15\n-4.56\n4.85\n\n\nelection_age\n-0.68\n-0.71\n-0.65"
